It is critical that scientific findings be reproducible so that they can be used in the real-world. Science that is not reproducible is essentially useless as it cannot be the basis of further research, nor can it be applied with reliable, predictable results. Reproducibility in coding is also important because it similarly verifies the validity of your findings and the ability for others to repeat your methods in other research.
